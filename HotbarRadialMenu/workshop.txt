description=Adds a radial menu for all hotbar items.

description=Expect bugs as this is my first Lua "project". (I have no idea what I'm really doing)

description=There will be a rewrite eventually.
description=The radial is not perfect, I don't like how each equip option is on it.
description=The idea is each hotbar item is it's own, and you select it and another radial asks if you want to equip it, equip it as a primary or a secondary, and an option to dequip it.
